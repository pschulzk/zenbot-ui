# Zenbot UI

## Description
A simple UI to view multiple stat files generated by [DeviaVir's Zenbot 4](https://github.com/DeviaVir/zenbot/).

## How to use
Put `index.html` into /stats/folder where by default Zenbot's data dump output files are written to and insert file name strings `const FILE_NAMES` in `index.html`'s `head` script.
